# 📱 Mobile Phone Success Rate Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to predict the success rate of mobile phones based on various features such as specifications, price, brand reputation, and customer reviews. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze key factors influencing a phone’s market performance and provide insights into its potential success.  

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Collect and preprocess data related to mobile phones (e.g., specifications, user ratings, pricing).  
- Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and relationships.  
- Train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a phone being successful.  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and optimize for accuracy.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost (or other ML models)
